# Round-Arbiter-SystemVerilog
Contains SystemVerilog RTL and TB code for implementing a Round Robin Arbiter , which can be parametrised to have variable time slices for different requesters.
FSM based implementation for a classic round robin arbiter. Can be used for designing a block that interfaces multiple AXI controllers (future ideas).
